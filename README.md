# Marco Polo üêº

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

This is a lost and found application that allows a user to search for their lost item and also allow users to post lost items.

## Description

This project was a collaborative effort to create a lost and found application that allows a user to search for their lost item and also allow users to post lost items. The application was created using React, Vite, GraphQL, Apollo Server, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Express.js, Nodemon, JWT, Bcrypt, ESLint and deployed on Heroku.

The motivation behind this project was to utilize everything we've learned in the bootcamp to create a full stack application. We wanted to create an application that would be useful for the community and also allow us to learn and utilize new technologies.

## Installation

The following steps were taken to complete the project:
- Review the purpose of the project, the user story and acceptance criteria
- Review the basics to starting a command-line application
- Review JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, React, Vite, GraphQL, Apollo Server, JWT, Bcrypt, ESLint and Heroku documentation
- Create Professional README file
- Write code (test, refactor and debug as needed)
- Add website image/gif to README file
- Submit URL to GitHub Repo and Heroku deployment URL
- Utilize Marco Polo application

## Usage

- Clone repo onto local device
- Open repo in local CLI
- Open the root folder in the CLI
- Make sure node packages are installed by running `npm i` in the CLI
    - This will `cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i` and install dependencies for the client and server folders
- Run `npm run seed` in the CLI, Heroku or other deployment platform to seed the database
    - This will `cd server && npm run seed` and seed the database
- Run `npm run develop` in the CLI to start server
    - This will run `concurrently \"cd server && npm run watch\" \"cd client && npm run dev\"` and start the server and client concurrently
- A dist folder will be created which will include a manifest.json and the src-sw.js files (along with all the other bundled files)
- Open up [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in the browser to view the marco polo application
- Use the lost and found app to search for lost items or report lost items
- Users can search for items and contact individuals to retrieve their lost items

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
